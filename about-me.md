Hi, my name is Antoine. Iâ€™m a French SEO living and working in Barcelona, Spain since 2016. I've lived in several Spanish-speaking countries since 2012 (Chile, Mexico, Spain) and I decided to start my professional career in Spain. 

I've discovered how search engines work during my time at the university and decided to make a living from it, first as a freelance and then as a full-time job. I worked during almost 4 years in an agency, before taking my first in-house gig at the beginning of 2020. 

I am lazy by nature, hence I am strongly interested in working in an efficient way, which is why I started to take some Python courses, not for the hype but for the huge potential I saw to optimize the way I was working. I've not been disappointed so far and I hope I will be able to share with you some good tips on this blog. 

If you are interested in speaking with me, you can find me online using the links in the footer.
